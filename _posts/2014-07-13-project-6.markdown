description: fitMe is the second project at GA during my WDI which was created as part of a group. This app would allow personal trainers/yoga teachers etc create profiles and list their services. Registered clients are able to browse through profiles and classes in a given fitness discipline. Once they are interested in someone they can request to book classes with him/her by sending them a private message. Because app would allow ability for both parties to leave feedback, trainers can also review clientâ€™s past feedback too and decide whether to accept the booking. This app does also for private communication between the instructor and client. TECHNOLOGIES - Ruby on Rails, JavaScript (JQuery), HTML (HAML), CSS (SASS)
